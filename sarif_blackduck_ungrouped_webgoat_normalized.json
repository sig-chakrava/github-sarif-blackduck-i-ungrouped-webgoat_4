It has to be set by the user. The directory itself should also be set up by the user since Ant may not have the correct permissions to do it automatically.\n\nIn [**1.10.8-rc1**](https://github.com/apache/ant/releases/tag/ANT_1.10.8_RC1), [this](https://github.com/apache/ant/commit/a8645a151bc706259fb1789ef587d05482d98612) commit was also added. It attempts to set secure temporary file permissions, but does not protect the directory. \n\nTherefore it is strongly recommended that users set up a private secure temporary directory with appropriate permissions.\n\nThe official mitigation for versions from **1.1** to **1.9.14** and **1.10.0** to **1.10.7** is setting the `java.io.tmpdir` system property to point to a directory only readable and writable by the current user prior to running Ant.\n\nVersions **1.9.15** and **1.10.8** can be trusted to use the Ant property `ant.tmpfile`, but the vendor still highly recommends using a safer private temporary directory instead.\n\n## Reference\nCommon Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-200](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html\n\n",

For recent releases, a temporary directory by created by making a directory called work in the `${jetty.base}` directory (the parent directory of the webapps directory). Alternately the java temporary directory can be set with the System Property `java.io.tmpdir`. A more detailed description of how jetty selects a temporary directory is below.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability the directory must be set to one that is not writable by an attacker. To avoid information leakage, the directory should also not be readable by an attacker.\n\n## Reference\nCommon Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-362](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/362.html\n\n",

For a normal distribution this can be done by putting the file into `${jetty.base}/lib`\n* Copy the file `${jetty.home}/modules/ssl.mod` to `${jetty.base}/modules`\n* Edit the `${jetty.base}/modules/ssl.mod` file to have the following section:\n```\n[lib]\nlib/sslfix6072.jar\n```\n\n* Copy the file `${jetty.home}/etc/jetty-https.xml` and `${jetty.home}/etc/jetty-http2.xml` to `${jetty.base}/etc`\n* Edit files `${jetty.base}/etc/jetty-https.xml` and `${jetty.base}/etc/jetty-http2.xml`, changing any reference of `org.eclipse.jetty.server.SslConnectionFactory` to `org.eclipse.jetty.server.ssl.fix6072.SpaceCheckingSslConnectionFactory`. \n\nFor example:\n```\n  \u003cCall name=\"addIfAbsentConnectionFactory\"\u003e\n    \u003cArg\u003e\n      \u003cNew class=\"org.eclipse.jetty.server.ssl.fix6072.SpaceCheckingSslConnectionFactory\"\u003e\n        \u003cArg name=\"next\"\u003ehttp/1.1\u003c/Arg\u003e\n        \u003cArg name=\"sslContextFactory\"\u003e\u003cRef refid=\"sslContextFactory\"/\u003e\u003c/Arg\u003e\n      \u003c/New\u003e\n    \u003c/Arg\u003e\n  \u003c/Call\u003e\n```\nRestart Jetty\n\n## Reference\nCommon Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html\n\n",
